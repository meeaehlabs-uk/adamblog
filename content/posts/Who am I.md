Hi I'm [Adam](https://adamhunter.uk) self-appointed Geek love all things tech who wanted to start a blog because its more tech skills to learn and develop.

I'll Post randomly here stuff I do with my Home Lab and stuff I do for real world needs/wants 

I have plans to start some content creation on YouTube in the not so distant future and will have a website up to help with finding videos and supporting documentation around it at [MeeaehLabs](https://meeaehlabs.co.uk) so keep an eye out for that.

Otherwise enjoy my random posts and I hope some may help you in your tech journey.
